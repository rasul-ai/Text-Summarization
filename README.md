## Choosing a Kaggle Dataset for Large Language Model Training
In this project, I have selected the CNN-DailyMail News Text Summarization dataset from Kaggle for training or fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM). In this file, I will provide an overview of why I have chosen this dataset and my considerations during the selection process.
### Dataset Overview
The CNN-DailyMail dataset is one of the widely used benchmark for text summarization tasks. It consists of news articles from CNN and DailyMail along with human-generated summaries. Each article has a single highlight .The dataset is well-structured, containing a large number of articles across various topics.
